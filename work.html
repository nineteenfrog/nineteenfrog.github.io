                    <p class="section px-6">This was my main project for my first semester of my master's at Abertay. I
                        had
                        the idea of creating a music video the recently released song by Chaeyoung from Twice called
                        Shoot
                        (Firecracker). The song touched themes of exploring your mind and imagination. I think this
                        paired
                        up well with a stylized and surreal art style. This project is not finshed but this is what I
                        submitted for the classes. The three main components of this project were:
                        <b><br>1. Motion Capture Pipeline:</b> Capturing footage with Shogun Live, exporting it with
                        Shogun
                        Post,
                        editing and cleaning it with Autodesk Maya, and finally retargeting in Unreal Engine
                        <b><br>2. Unreal Tool:</b> This tool was used to manipulate the animations to make them appear
                        as if
                        they
                        were animated in two's, three's, etc. all the way to ten's.
                        <b><br>3. Shaders Project:</b> I implemented a toon post process shader with the shaders system
                        in
                        Unreal
                        using HLSL to unify the art style.

                    I've been wanting to do a new project involving League of Legends since I've been playing so much
                    Legends of Runeterra. I also wanted to figure out how to create an IK FK switch now that I am
                    getting into scripting in Maya. I created this arm that is meant to be like Viktor's mechanical arm.
                    I was able to create a script that constraints the controllers to the correct joints in order to
                    switch. There's so many cool things you can do with scripts inside Maya and I'm just scratching the
                    surface. I'll create some textures and eventually see if I can import it into Unreal and attach it
                    to the Unreal mannequin。

                    While in college I was a teaching assistant and often had to grade hundreds of

                    slightly speed up my grading I could have more time to explain to students different concepts more
                    thouroughly. I created this script that would have helped me grade assignments quicker. It does some
                    simple asset validation checks and then diaplays a "score" with deductions. This was written all in
                    MEL. I am trying to adjust it in order to give it more use to the general public. Here is the github

                    time. During this time I worked on two main projects. One was the most complex rig I had ever done
                    with a reverse foot system, twist joints for arms and legs, and also facial controls. The other
                    consisted of creating a character from a concept image. I adjusted the concept art, 3D modeled the
                    character, textured, and rigged it. I also had to rig and model other props in the scene
                    and create the environment within maya. I also directed the scenes and did the lighting. Both of
                    these projects were really fun to work on.</p>

                <p class="section px-6">I wanted to explore the concept of procedural animation for small gestures like
                    foot placement and also reacting to obstacles in the environment. I used Unity's Animaiton Rigging
                    package to create some controllers and constraints in real time. Then I created this small demo in
                    which the character touches the wall as he walks by and also adjusts the foot placement based on an
                    obstacle. This was a mere proof of concept and I want to maybe implement a more robust demo. I might
                    even switch into Unreal Engine. Currently exploring where I could take this but this was a fun and
                    interesting project I have been working on.</p>

                    the character. The rig uses 3 skeletons: a skeleton for IK workflow, FK, and the main driven one.
                    The animator can switch between skeletons and the main skeleton is meant to be used when exporting
                    the animation. The character was created using Autodesk Maya and Substance Painter.</p>

                <p class="section px-6">The project started with the idea of rigging a bird and doing a physics based
                    feather flocking animation. I had recently lost my bird pet named Loki (he escaped :c) so I decided
                    to do use him as reference for my bird project. I researched what species they were and used
                    pictures to see anatomy and model in Maya. I did a low poly model and rigged all the body as well as
                    each individual feather. Then I added some dynamic curves for the feather joints to connect to. I
                    animated a wing flapping animation and the feathers moved dynamically. Then I created a fur system
                    using xGen for the feathers. I turned those feathers into polygons and then did a skin bind to the
                    rig. Once this was done, I brought it to Substance Painter where I gave it proper textures based on
                    its species (Agapornis personatus) and finally created a flocking animation using instances of the
                    bird. <strong>Note:</strong> Model wasn't optimized for a runtime application because I was just
                    going to render a video of the flocking animation. For game assets the ideal scenario would have
                    been to use alpha cards. </p>

                <p class="section px-6">The project started with me creating the mesh. Since it was a robotic
                    character I modeled individual pieces and then put them together using Maya. Also using Maya, I
                    created a rig that has an IK/FK switch. Once the Rig was done I took the model to Substance Painter.
                    I realized I hadn't done the UVs for the model but since I was using many repeated pieces in the
                    model, I UV unwrapped one of each piece and transfered the UVs to save time. Then I took it back to
                    Substance where I textured it. Once textured, I exported an FBX from Maya and imported it to Houdini
                    where I created a crowd simulation. Later I used the asset in one of my game projects <i>Into the
                        Rift</i>. I helped create an animation blueprint for the character and one of my teamates
                    programmed simple AI logic so that the robot would follow the player.</p>
